# KEYLOGGER (Educational Malware Demo)

⚠️ **DISCLAIMER**  
This project is intended **strictly for learning, research, and security awareness purposes only**.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how **malware typically behaves on a Windows system**, including:

- Persistence mechanisms  
- Input (keystroke) capture  
- Silent/background execution  
- Outbound communication  

The purpose of this project is to help students and security practitioners understand **what malware looks like when it runs** and **why modern antivirus and EDR solutions are able to detect it**.

## Important Notes

- ❌ Not intended for real-world deployment  
- ❌ Not intended for unauthorized monitoring or surveillance  
- ❌ Do not run on systems you do not own or without explicit permission  

## Intended Use

- Cybersecurity education  
- Malware behavior demonstrations  
- Blue-team / defensive security learning  
- Awareness presentations and labs  

Run **only in isolated or controlled environments** (e.g., virtual machines).

## Legal & Ethical Reminder

Unauthorized use of software that captures input or persists on a system may be illegal.  
The author takes **no responsibility for misuse** of this project.
